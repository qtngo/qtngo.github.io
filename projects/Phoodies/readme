Purpose of phoodies.net... 
	- an adventure of our food trip.
	- a fun blog to start out.
		- food adventure. ie. Facebook, one-day trip (why does that place have pho there? :P)
		- why did we choose to go to that location?
	- How we go about getting there.
	- Did we go there bc of Yelp reviews or for pure adventures.
	- Show people who we got to that place and why we chose to go there.
	- Really random, no research. Sometimes we get a HIT and sometimes we get a MISS.
	- Do we mention all of them? or just the good place.
		- maybe the Santa Cruz Diner might have been good??? Now we must check it out.
	- WHAT is the fun factor and how did we choose where we go?
	- How do we score it? the Experience? the food only?
	- Authenticity of the foods?

New Thought:
	- Home page = Map of USA
		- Click on a State
		- Click on City
		- Drop a pin on where the pho restuarant was at.
			- pin icon = a bowl of pho
			- pin icon or arrow = a pair of chopsticks
		- Have a blog of the pho in that area/city
		- people sign in to add their locations
		- Have people talk to each other, add comments
	- VN food = Pho. American = Hamburger. Mexican = Taco. Japanese = Sushi/Fish.
